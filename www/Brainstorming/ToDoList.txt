### To do ###
- Find out how added images don't affect the margin and padding. Need's to be done in VanillaJS.
- Figure out the milliseconds logic.
- Assign either variables or transform effects for the lines.
- Make the number variables for the 1s, 10s and 100s.
- Add the logic to the number variables.

- Make a new menu screen "logo", too blurry at the moment.
