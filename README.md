Incermental game. Tomi, Sean &amp; Ali.

This app will be a one screen app where the objective is to click the target to increase your score. There will be power-ups to make incrementing your score easier that can be obtained by using the points you gain by clicking. The game continues incrememnting your score even though the app is closed. Every X seconds the program will save your progress in local memory. We have decided to drop the ionic framework and use vanilla js since ionic is not best suited for this type of app.

QUESTIONS:

1. Is it ok to use phaser framework to create this app?
2.
